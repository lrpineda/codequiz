# codequiz - Challenge 4
## Acceptance Criteria
- User will be shown a code quiz.
- When user clicks the start quiz button:
    - A timer starts and is presented with a question.
    - When the user answers a question, then the user is presented with another question.
- If user answers incorrectly then time is substracted from the clock.
- When user answers all the questions or the timer reaches 0:
    - The game is over 
    - The user can save their initials and score. 

## Description
For this challenge I decided to follow the example provided and get as close as the original. The scoring system had to be changed to something more basic rather than using the seconds left as a score (like in the example).
